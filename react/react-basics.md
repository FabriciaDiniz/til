### Basic Concepts
- Functional components (which are just functions) should just return the JSX you want them to represent
  - if you're returning more than one line of code, it is good practice to wrap it in parenthesis
  - they are passed to ReactDOM.render surrounded by JSX tags
    -ex: <MyFunction />
  - it's good practice to have just one functional component per file

### Starting and applications
- You can start an application using npx creat-react-app app-name
  - you need to have npm and node.js installed


### TODO
- Check out React fragments (easier to style encapsulated stuff)
